We often forget that random events can be independent. \r\n\r\nIf you've ever watched a roulette wheel at a casino, for example, and the ball lands on red 5 times in a row, you might think that it should land on black on the next spin -- but the chances of getting red or black on the next spin never change, and are always independent of what has come before. Same goes for coin flips -- assuming you're flipping a fair coin, whether you flipped heads 1 time or 10 in the past, it's just as likely to come up heads as it is likely to come up tails on the next flip: 50%.
